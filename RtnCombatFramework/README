This script makes combat management easier by handling these things:
- Automatically sorts turn order
- Automatically counts rounds and combat rounds (handles dynamic change of turn order)
- Pings the respective tokens on the board when it is their turn
- Allows players to advance the round when their turn is finished

To clear the turnorder and prepare for a new combat encounter, use the `!combat init` command in the chat, to start tracking simply click the chat button.
If the turn order is already set, you can alternatively start tracking with `!combat startTrack`, after that you can advance and end the encounter via chat buttons.
Should the buttons not work, you can also advance the turn with `!combat nextRound` and end it with `combat stopTrack`
